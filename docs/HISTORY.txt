Changelog
=========

1.0rc3 - Unreleased
-------------------


1.0rc2 - Released November 17th, 2008
-------------------------------------

* Fix issue where, when the "auto flush" feature is enabled, an indexing
  helper could cause an infinite loop by using the catalog.
  [witsch]

* Restore and extend test regarding package installation.
  [witsch]

1.0rc1 - Released November 5th, 2008
------------------------------------

* Restored processQueue function as it is conceptually important.
  [stefan]

1.0b5 - Released October 16th, 2008
-----------------------------------

* Fix transaction handling to properly abort indexing operations.
  [witsch]

* Refactor helper method for auto-flushing the queue to make it more easily
  re-usable.
  [witsch]

* Enable the monkey patch for `PloneTool.reindexOnReorder` in all versions
  of Plone 3.x as it's not been ported upstream yet.  This fixes
  http://plone.org/products/collective.indexing/issues/1
  [witsch]

* Refactor auto-flush monkey-patch to not interfere with testing.
  [witsch]

* Patched CatalogTool.searchResults to process the indexing queue before
  issuing a query (aka auto-flush).
  [stefan]

* Fix test isolation issues and improve test setup.
  [witsch]

* Made sure QueueReducer sorts results by opcode. Unindex operations must
  be handled before (re)index operations.
  [stefan]

* Added processQueue function to process a queue immediately.
  [stefan]

* Fixed testModifyObject in Plone 3.1 by clearing the file's creation flag
  in afterSetUp.
  [stefan]

* Fixed testQueuesOnTwoThreads on Linux by sleeping for a moment so threads
  can do their work.
  [stefan]

1.0b4 - Released June 30th, 2008
--------------------------------

* Perform processing of the queue during "active" state of the transaction
  as additional changes are forbidden in "committing" state.  Those changes
  can for example be caused by indexes writing back data to content items,
  such as the modification time.
  [witsch, mj]

1.0b3 - Released June 18th, 2008
--------------------------------

* Fix an issue where objects providing their own `__setattr__` could
  potentially not be deleted.
  [witsch]

1.0b2 - Released June 2nd, 2008
-------------------------------

* Add `aq_inner` to prevent infinite recursion with `safe_hasattr`.
  [witsch]

1.0b1 - Released May 28, 2008
-----------------------------

* Make sure we get REQUEST correctly in PathWrapper.
  [tesdal]

1.0a3 - Released May 28, 2008
-----------------------------

* Respect overridden indexing methods to prevent erroneous indexing and
  generally allow special handling.
  [witsch]

* Fix leftover index entry after renaming an object.
  [witsch]

* The bad monkey smacked back with a vengeance, but was finally tamed.
  [witsch]

* Smacked a bad monkey that was checking for nonexisting attribute
  getObjPositionInParent.
  [tesdal]

1.0a2 - Released May 25, 2008
-----------------------------

* Fix bug regarding different types in the queue reducer logic.
  [fschulze]

* Fixed renaming of content items by replacing `PloneTool.reindexOnReorder`
  with a saner version that doesn't rely on the catalog.
  [witsch]

* Various fixes, cleanups and optimizations.
  [witsch]

* Fixed monkey patches so that normal indexing remains functional when queued
  indexing has been deactivated (or the GS profile had not been applied yet).
  [witsch]

1.0a1 - Released March 31, 2008
-------------------------------

* Initial release
  [tesdal, witsch]
